Using your semester project data, create three well-formatted data visualizations. Examples might include scatter plots,
histograms, heatmaps, correlation plots, etc. Describe what the basic insights are for each visualization.
Select a response variable (i.e., what you’d like to predict). Then select some or all of the remaining variables as features
(i.e., the variables you’ll use to predict the response variable). Fit a linear regression model that predicts your repones
variable as a function of the available features, and report an accuracy metric (such as R2). Plot the predicted vs.
observed datapoints (i.e., the plot in which a perfect model would show all predictions along the 45 degree line).
Finally, plot your accuracy metric over a range of model complexity (similar to the bias-variance tradeoff plot). You can
consider the number of features in your model to be a measure of its complexity. This exercise involves iteratively fitting a
model and recording its resulting accuracy. In the first iteration, fit the model with only one feature. In the second iteration,
fit the model using two features, and so forth, with the final model using all available features.

Deliverable
Turn in a well-formatted short report that includes:
• Your three data visualizations and resulting insights;
• Plot of predicted vs. observed data points using your fitted linear regression model, with an accuracy metric
(such as R2) included on the plot;
• Plot of model accuracy over a range of model complexity. Describe why this curve is shaped the way it is.
