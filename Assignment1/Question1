Acquire a publicly-available dataset that you’ll use for your semester project. You are free to choose any dataset
that interests you; however, you’ll want to choose one that allows you to demonstrate the techniques we’ll learn in
the course (i.e., problem formulation, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and
predictive modeling). You’ll also want to choose a dataset that includes documentation as to what’s in the dataset;
this will help you debug and interpret your results.

Turn in a well-formatted short (1-2 pages) report that:
• Describes your dataset, including formal citations in APA (or similar style) format of the dataset itself, along
with any research publications that have used the dataset
• Articulate your problem statement, including the “business value” of solving the problem (i.e., what benefit
will solving the problem create for end-users or other stakeholders?)
• Describes any challenges you anticipate facing, and how you might address them.
Note that putting effort into each assignment will help you enormously in your final project.
