Assignment Description
Using your semester project problem statement, dataset, selected features, and any feature engineering you performed:
• Partition your data into training, validation, and testing datasets.
• Briefly discuss your strategy for this partitioning (e.g., simple random sample, stratified sampling, etc.)
Next, train several candidate predictive models:
• Train 1-2 complex model forms (e.g., neural network, random forest, etc.)
• Train 1-2 simpler, transparent model forms (e.g., decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, etc.)
• Compare the performance of each trained model.
Finally, select the model for which you’d recommend deploying to address your problem statement, and briefly discuss
your basis for that selection (e.g., considering a balance between accuracy and transparency). Briefly identify any model
or data improvements that would be needed prior to deploying the model.

Deliverable
