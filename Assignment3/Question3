Systematically review each feature in your semester project dataset. Briefly document the following points for each
feature:
• What the feature represents
• What datatype the feature is (e.g., categorical, numerical, float, integer, etc.)
• A judgement as to whether the feature might be an important predictor of your target variable
• Some characterization of the range of observed values (e.g., mean and standard deviation for numerical
variables, list or description of the levels for categorical variables)
• Identify if any transformation (e.g., log transform) or encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding) might be needed to use the
feature in a predictive model

Deliverable
Submit a well-formatted short report that addresses each of the above points.
