Using your assignment submissions, create a final report that describes your:
• Problem statement
• Exploratory data analysis
• Feature engineering
• Modeling results
• Deployment recommendations
The report should be a well-formatted, clear, and succinct description of your analysis, results, and reccomendations.
Include your main insights in the report body, and move lengthy details (if any) to an appendix.
